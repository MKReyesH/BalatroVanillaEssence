# Balatro Vanilla Essence

Vanilla Essence is a simple texture pack for the game Balatro featuring many ideas from the Balatro [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/balatro).

Disclaimer: This work has been inspired by and has used some assets from other authors. Credits to their respective authors.

The most relevant features are:

- Standard two-color suits for normal mode.

- Card-creation tarots are full-body colored. The planet and tarot creation cards match the colors of the planet and tarot seals, respectively (inspired by [@Moonspell](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1292684173735366769)).

Seal-creation spectral cards have the seal stamped on them (inspired by [@Moonspell](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1292684173735366769)).

- Planet cards use the black-figure card icon for the poker hands when possible (larger and more legible). When the poker hand requires cards of the same suit, the background of the card is light-yellow colored.
