# Balatro Vanilla Essence

Vanilla Essence is a simple texture pack for the game Balatro featuring many ideas from the Balatro [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/balatro).

- Card-creation tarots are full-body colored. The planet and tarot creation cards match the colors of the planet and tarot seals, respectively (inspired by [@Moonspell](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1292684173735366769)). Fool tarot is a mixture of the previous.

- Planet cards use the black figure card icon for the poker hands when possible (larger and more legible). When the poker hand requires cards of the same suit, the background of the card is light-yellow colored.
